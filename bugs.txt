Commands which work perfectly:
1. vcs init
2. vcs set
3. vcs ls-tree
4. vcs cat-file
5. vcs hash-object
6. vcs log
7. vcs checkout

Things to do-
1. Disallow __pycache__, libvcs.py, vcs file from being part of the commit
2. Todos mentioned in the libvcs.py file
3. Make viewing of commit logs more closer to git way in terminal
4. Add verbose and debug mode for the whole library
5. Provide feature to know that commit is not necessary if no change has incurred in the repo
6. Add branches facility

cat-file only returns content of blob files and commit files and for other files, (tree and tag), byte content is printed
as for tree file, ls-tree command is used for printing the content.
