Commands which work perfectly:
1. vcs init
2. vcs set
3. vcs ls-tree
4. vcs cat-file
5. vcs hash-object


Commands which has bug:
commit
log
checkout (not tried yet)
ls-tree

Things to do-
1. Disallow __pycache__, libvcs.py, vcs file from being part of the commit
2. Todos mentioned in the libvcs.py file

cat-file only returns content of blob files and commit files and for other files, (tree and tag), byte content is printed
as for tree file, ls-tree command is used for printing the content.
